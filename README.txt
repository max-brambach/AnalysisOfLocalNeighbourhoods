# Analysis of Local Neighbourhoods
Repository containing tools to generate organisational features of point clouds. Uses Voronoi diagrams and kernel density estimations to describe the arrangement of local point-neighbourhoods in an object centred way (the object being individual points of the cloud).

This framework currently requires a custom version of voro++ (can be found here https://github.com/max-brambach/voro).
